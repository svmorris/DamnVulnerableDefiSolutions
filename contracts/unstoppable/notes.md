Breaking the contract
=====================

The contract checks its own balance to some sort of shares thing. I think the best way to break the contract would be to somehow make the balance before different from the shares thing.

However, I have no idea what the shares thing is


There is a deposit function that is used to give money to the contract, rather than just transferring to it. I still don't understand how the shares work, but I assume the deposit function updates them. Maybe there is a way to directly transfer some small amount of tokens to the contract that would break it
