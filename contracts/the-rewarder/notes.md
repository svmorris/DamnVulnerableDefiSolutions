Getting the largest reward
==========================

Random ideas
------------

Its sort of clear that the challenge is directing you towards taking out a massive flashloan, and dumping it into the rewarder.

The only way I can think of this working is if we do it after the 5 day mark. In which case we would put a huge amount of money in, claim our reward, then withdraw it and send it back to the flashloan contract in one transaction.


Id need to figure out how to know or control the 5 day bit


Rewards also only get paid out if you had money at the current snapshot. Which further shows that the only way to do this is to dump a huge amount of money after the snapshot period is over.

By default, it is  not a new round
